## Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- **Browser limitations** - Constrained by browser storage limits and performance
- **Relay reliability** - Dependent on user-chosen relays for availability and persistence
- **Key management** - Users responsible for backing up and securing their keys
- **Network connectivity** - Requires internet connection for syncing with relays
- **Nostr ecosystem** - Limited by current state of Nostr protocol and tooling
- **Client-side processing** - All encryption/search must happen in browser

### User Experience Constraints
- **Nostr knowledge** - Users need basic understanding of Nostr keys and relays
- **Key responsibility** - Users must manage their own private keys securely
- **Relay setup** - Users should configure reliable relays for best experience
- **No cloud backup** - No centralized backup; users responsible for key backup
- **Limited collaboration** - Collaboration features simpler than centralized platforms
- **Sync limitations** - Notes only sync when application is open

### Scope Limitations
- **Text only** - Markdown text notes only, no rich media or attachments initially
- **Simple collaboration** - Basic sharing and comments, not real-time collaboration
- **No server features** - No server-side search, analytics, or advanced features
- **Relay dependent** - Performance and reliability depend on chosen relays
- **Single-user focus** - Optimized for individual note-taking, not team workflows
- **Browser-based only** - Web application only, no native mobile apps initially

## Next Steps

1. **Set up development environment** - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
2. **Integrate nostr-tools** - Set up basic Nostr connection and key management
3. **Build basic editor** - Implement CodeMirror markdown editor with preview
4. **Implement NIP-23** - Store and retrieve notes as long-form content events
5. **Add local storage** - Implement IndexedDB for local note caching and offline support

## Example Usage

This updated project overview provides a realistic foundation for building a Nostr-based note-taking application. An AI assistant can use this information to:

- **Implement Nostr protocols** - Use specific NIPs (23, 17, 44) for different features
- **Build with nostr-tools** - Leverage the mature nostr-tools library for all Nostr functionality
- **Design practical UX** - Create interfaces appropriate for decentralized note-taking
- **Plan incremental development** - Build core features first, then add advanced functionality
- **Handle real constraints** - Address actual limitations of browser-based Nostr applications
- **Create user documentation** - Develop guides that explain how decentralized note-taking works

The key is providing enough detail about realistic features and technical constraints while staying within the actual capabilities of current Nostr infrastructure and tooling. This approach leads to a viable product rather than an overly ambitious project that can't be completed.
