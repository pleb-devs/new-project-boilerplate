# new-project-boilerplate
Boilerplate prompts, documentatiom, and process for building LLM driven applications.

## What is new-project-boilerplate?

new-project-boilerplate provides a systematic methodology for starting projects with solid foundations. Instead of jumping straight into code, it guides you through creating comprehensive documentation that defines your project's structure, rules, and implementation plan.

## Key Features

- **Documentation-First Approach** - Build comprehensive project documentation before coding
- **AI-Optimized** - Structured for maximum compatibility with AI development tools
- **Systematic Setup** - Step-by-step process from concept to implementation
- **Best Practices** - Industry-standard coding conventions and project structure
- **Iterative Development** - Phased approach from MVP to full-featured application

## Quick Start

1. **Follow the Setup Guide**: Start with [`llm/setup.md`](llm/setup.md) for the complete walkthrough
2. **Define Your Project**: Create a detailed project overview using the example template
3. **Build Documentation**: Generate user flows, tech stack, design rules, and project conventions
4. **Plan Development**: Outline iterative development phases from setup to MVP
5. **Start Building**: Begin development with a solid foundation in place

## Documentation Structure

```
llm/
├── setup.md                  # Complete setup walkthrough
├── project-overview-example.md # Template for project definition
├── project-overview.md       # Your project definition
├── user-flow.md             # User journey mapping
├── tech-stack.md            # Technology choices and conventions
├── design-rules.md          # UI principles and styling guidelines
├── project-rules.md         # Coding standards and file organization
└── phases/                  # Development phase planning
    ├── setup-phase.md
    ├── mvp-phase.md
    └── [additional-phases].md
```

## Why Documentation-First?

- **Clarity**: Clear project vision before implementation
- **Consistency**: Established patterns and conventions
- **Collaboration**: Better AI assistance and team alignment
- **Scalability**: Modular, maintainable codebase from day one
- **Efficiency**: Reduced decision fatigue during development

## Getting Started

Begin by following the setup guide in [`llm/setup.md`](llm/setup.md) to establish your project foundation and development workflow.
