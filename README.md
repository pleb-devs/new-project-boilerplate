# new-project-boilerplate
Boilerplate prompts, documentatiom, and process for building LLM driven applications.

## What is new-project-boilerplate?

new-project-boilerplate provides a systematic methodology for starting projects with solid foundations. Instead of jumping straight into code, it guides you through creating comprehensive documentation that defines your project's structure, rules, and implementation plan.

## Key Features

- **Documentation-First Approach** - Build comprehensive project documentation before coding
- **AI-Optimized** - Structured for maximum compatibility with AI development tools
- **Systematic Setup** - Step-by-step process from concept to implementation
- **Best Practices** - Industry-standard coding conventions and project structure
- **Iterative Development** - Phased approach from MVP to full-featured application

## Quick Start

1. **Follow the Setup Guide**: Start with [`llm/project/setup.md`](llm/project/setup.md) for the complete walkthrough
2. **Define Your Project**: Create a detailed project overview using the example template
3. **Build Documentation**: Generate user flows, tech stack, design rules, and project conventions; consult the [AI Dev Program freedom-tech guide](https://github.com/pleb-devs/freedom-tech) for relevant sovereign-focused libraries
4. **Plan Development**: Outline iterative development phases from setup to MVP
5. **Start Building**: Begin development with a solid foundation in place

## Why Documentation-First?

- **Clarity**: Clear project vision before implementation
- **Consistency**: Established patterns and conventions
- **Collaboration**: Better AI assistance and team alignment
- **Scalability**: Modular, maintainable codebase from day one
- **Efficiency**: Reduced decision fatigue during development

## Getting Started

Begin by following the setup guide in [`llm/project/setup.md`](llm/project/setup.md) to establish your project foundation and development workflow, referencing the [AI Dev Program freedom-tech guide](https://github.com/pleb-devs/freedom-tech) when it surfaces helpful technologies.
